            <h2>About me</h2> 
            <p>I am Gabriela Araujo, 35 years of age, Brazilian, and I have been married for 14 years, but I do not have kids (and I do not plan on having any). I'm very passionate, and I never stray from a challenge. Be that in life or on the mat, because I am a black belt in <abbr title="Taekwondo">TKD</abbr> (1<sup>st</sup>dan or 1<sup>st</sup> black belt level). </p> 
            <p>Something else that defines me is how much I have traveled. So far, I have visited over 20 countries! Even though it is not easy moving around as much, I have had the privilege to meet new cultures, learn new languages, and grow immensely as a person in the process.</p>
